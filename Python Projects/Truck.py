# Truck class should have the following attributes & methods
#
# Old Attributes:
#   color, max_speed, acceleration, tyre_friction, is_engine_started, current_speed
# New Attributes:
#     max_cargo_weight, load
#
# Old Methods:
#   start_engine, stop_engine, accelerate, apply_brakes, sound_horn
# 
# Override Methods:
#   sound_horn:
#       - Print "Honk Honk" if truck engine is on
#       - Print "Car has not started yet" if truck engine is off
#
# New Methods:
#   load_cargo:
#       - This method will have an argument cargo_weight, denoting the weight to be loaded in the truck.
#       - Truck can load some cargo within max_cargo_weight
#       - When this method is called when the car engine is off, the  current_load of the truck
#         should increase according to the  cargo_weight  passed as an argument to this method.
#       - When this method is called when the car engine is on, print the message  "Cannot load cargo during motion"
#       - When the cargo_weight is more than max_cargo_weight,
#           print the message  "Cannot load cargo more than max limit: {max_cargo_weight}"
#   unload_cargo:
#       - This method will have an argument cargo_weight, denoting the weight to be unloaded from the truck.
#       - Truck can unload amount of cargo_weight passed as an argument, only when the truck engine is off.
#       - If the truck engine is on, print the message "Cannot unload cargo during motion"
#       - Truck load can never go behind 0
#
# When a new Truck is created, the engine should be off by default and current_speed, load should be 0


# Implement the Car and Truck class appropriately
# Inherit the Car class into Truck class and override the methods which have extra features
